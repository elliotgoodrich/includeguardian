# IncludeGuardian

## Getting Started

  1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio
  2. Install Python 3
  3. `pip install conan`
  4. Open `src` folder with Microsoft Visual Studio

## Aim

IncludeGuardian will sort all of the include directives in your project by the
total number of bytes of code that would need to be compiled by your
application.  This will give developers a targetted list of include
directives to attempt to remove in order to reduce compilation time.

For example:

```
  foo.cpp                          bar.cpp
  +---------------------+          +--------------------+
  | #include <foo.hpp>  |          | #include <bar.hpp> |
  |                     |          | #include <foo.hpp> |
  | // other code       |          |                    |
  +---------------------+    .-----| // more code       |
              |             /      +--------------------+
              |            /                  |
  foo.hpp     v           v        bar.hpp    v
  +-----------------------+        +-----------------------+
  | #include <common.hpp> |        | #include <common.hpp> |
  | #include <iostream>   |        | #include <memory>     |
  |                       |        |                       |
  | // code               |        | // lorem ipsum        |
  +-----------------------+        +-----------------------+
              |                        |
              \     common.hpp         v
               \    +----------------------+
                '-->| #include <algorithm> |
                    | #include <iostream>  |
                    +----------------------+
```

It probably should list the following include directories in the order of:

| Include Directive                      | `<iostream>` | `<algorithm>` | `<memory>` | `foo.hpp` | `bar.hpp` | `common.hpp` |
| -------------------------------------- |:------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:------------:|
| `#include <foo.hpp>` in `foo.cpp`      |      X       |       X       |            |     X     |           |      X       |
| `#include <algorithm>` in `common.hpp` |              |      2X       |            |           |           |              |
| `#include <common.hpp>` in `foo.hpp`   |              |       X       |            |           |           |      X       |
| `#include <bar.hpp>` in `bar.cpp`      |              |               |      X     |           |    X      |              |
| `#include <common.hpp>` in `bar.hpp`   |              |               |      X     |           |           |              |
| `#include <memory>` in `bar.hpp`       |              |               |      X     |           |           |              |
| `#include <foo.hpp>` in `bar.cpp`      |              |               |            |     X     |           |              |

Assuming that `<iostream>` > `<algorithm>` > `<memory>` and the non-standard
headers are small in comparison.

Some of these suggestion are probably not feasible, for example removing
`#include <foo.hpp>` from `foo.cpp`.

Additionally, IncludeGuardian will warn developers when they open a pull
request that they are adding in an include directive that is particularly
expensive.  This should be configurable by the user, for example warn if
an include directive is in the top decile of expensive directives.

Although creating the initial list may be expensive, IncludeGuard should
strive to have a quick response on new pull requests.
