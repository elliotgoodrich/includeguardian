            <h1>IncludeGuardian</h1>
            <p>IncludeGuardian is a free tool to <strong>help improve C and C++ build
                    times</strong>. The most time consuming part of C++ build times is usually not
                compiling or linking, but in preprocessing and syntax checking files that have been
                <code>#include</code>ed. A simple "Hello World" application in C++ will be
                preprocessed to almost a 1MB file from only the <code>#include
                    &lt;iostream&gt;</code> line. This is all run through the C++ compiler and will
                take an additional 150ms to check. </p>
            <p>IncludeGuardian makes recommendations for your project on how to reduce work the
                compiler needs to do. These suggestions include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What files to add to a precompiled header
                <li>Which <code>#include</code> directives are the most expensive
                <li>Which header files should be split up
                <li>Which header+source pairs are unused
                <li>Which header+source files should be combined to be header-only
                <li>Which files have an incorrect include guard
            </ul>
            <p>With each suggestion IncludeGuardian will give a percentage saving for the number of
                preprocessing tokens that need to be compiled. Although this is not a perfect
                substitute for the actual time saved, it is a reasonable alternative that will give
                a deterministic result in a fraction of the time.</p>
